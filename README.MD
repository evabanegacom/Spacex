To maximize net revenue for the next 12 months on this route, the pricing product manager for Lyft's ride-scheduling feature in Toledo, Ohio should adjust Lyft's take to balance driver and rider incentives and increase the match rate.
The first step is to determine the optimal Lyft take rate that maximizes net revenue. To do this, we need to consider the impact of changes in Lyft's take rate on both driver earnings and rider demand.
If Lyft reduces its take rate, drivers will earn more per ride, which may encourage more drivers to join and stay on the platform, reducing churn and increasing the supply of available drivers. However, reducing Lyft's take rate may also decrease the company's revenue per ride.
On the rider side, reducing Lyft's take rate could lower the price for riders, making it more attractive to use the service and potentially increasing demand. However, if there are not enough drivers available to meet demand, riders may experience more "failed to find driver" events, leading to higher churn rates and reduced revenue.
Based on the previous pricing experiment, it appears that reducing Lyft's take rate from $6/ride to $3/ride increases match rates from 60% to roughly 93%. This suggests that Lyft's take rate is currently too high and reducing it will increase revenue.
To find the optimal Lyft take rate, we can use a simulation model to test different scenarios and measure the impact on net revenue. We can start by reducing Lyft's take rate from $6/ride to $4/ride and measuring the impact on driver supply, rider demand, and net revenue. If the increase in driver supply and rider demand outweighs the reduction in revenue per ride, we can continue to reduce the Lyft take rate until we reach the optimal balance that maximizes net revenue.
We should also consider the impact of driver earnings on churn rates. If increasing driver earnings by reducing Lyft's take rate leads to lower driver churn rates, this could have a positive impact on net revenue in the long run.
In summary, to maximize net revenue on this route in Toledo, Ohio, the pricing product manager for Lyft's ride-scheduling feature should adjust Lyft's take rate to balance driver and rider incentives and increase the match rate. By using a simulation model to test different scenarios, the manager can find the optimal Lyft take rate that maximizes net revenue while ensuring a positive experience for both drivers and riders.


EXPLANATION OF THE RESPONSE ABOVE

The idea of adjusting Lyft's take rate to maximize net revenue is based on the understanding that the pricing structure of a two-sided marketplace like Lyft's ride-scheduling feature is a delicate balance between driver earnings and rider demand. The prevailing rate that people are used to paying for rides and the prevailing wage that drivers are used to earning set a baseline for what is acceptable to both sides of the market.
However, when there is a mismatch between driver earnings and rider demand, the marketplace can experience liquidity problems, where there are not enough drivers to meet demand or not enough demand to keep drivers active. This can lead to "failed to find driver" events, which can increase churn rates and reduce revenue.
To address these liquidity problems, the pricing product manager needs to adjust Lyft's take rate to balance driver earnings and rider demand. By reducing Lyft's take rate, drivers earn more per ride, which can encourage more drivers to join and stay on the platform, reducing churn and increasing the supply of available drivers. At the same time, reducing Lyft's take rate can lower the price for riders, making it more attractive to use the service and potentially increasing demand.
By using a simulation model to test different scenarios, the pricing product manager can find the optimal Lyft take rate that maximizes net revenue while ensuring a positive experience for both drivers and riders. The simulation model can measure the impact of changes in Lyft's take rate on driver supply, rider demand, and net revenue, allowing the manager to make data-driven decisions that balance the needs of both sides of the market.
